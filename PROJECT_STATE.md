## B4 current architecture

Ordinary local avoidance is receding-horizon and command-continuous.

A local solve is responsible for the **next safe executable geometric segment**,
not for completing an artificial leave-route-and-return loop inside one horizon.

```text
nominal route
 -> bounded physical horizon
 -> projected/static conflict
 -> safe short offset segment if available
 -> execute
 -> refresh from actual state
 -> continue offset or begin route reacquisition
```

If no safe short offset exists, navigation remains active and returns braking
intent. It is not disabled and it does not surrender ownership.

The route is reacquired progressively. No fixed distance, including 30 m, is a
required merge point.

## Removed/superseded behavior

Still forbidden:
- angular deflection fan;
- azimuth branch search;
- persistent left/right branch continuity;
- branch-switch API;
- mandatory Brake-before-changing-side recovery.

Also superseded:
- mandatory same-horizon current->bypass->merge proof;
- treating the current bounded nominal endpoint as a compulsory return point.

## Current milestone

Target-machine validation of the corrected receding-horizon B4 behavior.

The final composite must distinguish:
- geometry can evade -> continue through proved local free space;
- geometry cannot evade -> braking command while navigation continues;
- physical compiler cannot execute geometric bypass -> higher maneuver
  ownership brakes/replans rather than accepting an impossible maneuver.

## Other block status

Accepted/strong:
- B0 snapshot ownership;
- B7 maneuver decision mechanics;
- B8 accepted program;
- B9 sampler;
- B10 bounded tracking;
- B12 PilotSkill;
- B13 propulsion/physics;
- B14 scheduler mechanics.

Still incomplete/transitional:
- B1 shared influence builder;
- B2 unified objective;
- B3 coarse vehicle-aware topology feasibility;
- B4 receding-horizon local bypass under target validation;
- B5 general production maneuver compiler;
- B6 generalized continuous proof;
- B11 explicit safety/reflex monitor;
- ordinary-live migration of accepted-program execution.

## State protocol

After every state/evidence change synchronize project state MDs, active Stage-12,
and recreate `CONTINUE_PROMPT.md` from scratch.

## Composite physical fallback

The final composite no longer treats `fit.valid == false` as an automatic
test failure. If the geometric B4 segment cannot be authored within the
vehicle's current physical authority, the test now executes active braking
through the real PilotSkill/physics path, keeps the hazard authoritative,
and then continues the receding-horizon replan loop.

This directly pins the required rule:
- can evade physically -> execute bypass;
- cannot evade physically -> brake;
- navigation ownership remains active in both cases.
