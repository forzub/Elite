## B4 current architecture

Ordinary local avoidance is receding-horizon and command-continuous.

A local solve is responsible for the **next safe executable geometric segment**,
not for completing an artificial leave-route-and-return loop inside one horizon.

```text
nominal route
 -> bounded physical horizon
 -> projected/static conflict
 -> safe short offset segment if available
 -> execute
 -> refresh from actual state
 -> continue offset or begin route reacquisition
```

If no safe short offset exists, navigation remains active and returns braking
intent. It is not disabled and it does not surrender ownership.

The route is reacquired progressively. No fixed distance, including 30 m, is a
required merge point.

## Removed/superseded behavior

Still forbidden:
- angular deflection fan;
- azimuth branch search;
- persistent left/right branch continuity;
- branch-switch API;
- mandatory Brake-before-changing-side recovery.

Also superseded:
- mandatory same-horizon current->bypass->merge proof;
- treating the current bounded nominal endpoint as a compulsory return point.

## Current milestone

Target-machine validation of the corrected receding-horizon B4 behavior.

The final composite must distinguish:
- geometry can evade -> continue through proved local free space;
- geometry cannot evade -> braking command while navigation continues;
- physical compiler cannot execute geometric bypass -> higher maneuver
  ownership brakes/replans rather than accepting an impossible maneuver.

## Other block status

Accepted/strong:
- B0 snapshot ownership;
- B7 maneuver decision mechanics;
- B8 accepted program;
- B9 sampler;
- B10 bounded tracking;
- B12 PilotSkill;
- B13 propulsion/physics;
- B14 scheduler mechanics.

Still incomplete/transitional:
- B1 shared influence builder;
- B2 unified objective;
- B3 coarse vehicle-aware topology feasibility;
- B4 receding-horizon local bypass under target validation;
- B5 general production maneuver compiler;
- B6 generalized continuous proof;
- B11 explicit safety/reflex monitor;
- ordinary-live migration of accepted-program execution.

## State protocol

After every state/evidence change synchronize project state MDs, active Stage-12,
and recreate `CONTINUE_PROMPT.md` from scratch.

## Composite physical fallback

The final composite no longer treats `fit.valid == false` as an automatic
test failure. If the geometric B4 segment cannot be authored within the
vehicle's current physical authority, the test now executes active braking
through the real PilotSkill/physics path, keeps the hazard authoritative,
and then continues the receding-horizon replan loop.

This directly pins the required rule:
- can evade physically -> execute bypass;
- cannot evade physically -> brake;
- navigation ownership remains active in both cases.

## 2026-09-20 target run `navigation_test_20260920-182430.txt`

Important: the uploaded log does **not** contain the tested HEAD line, so the
exact checkout must not be inferred from the filename or current repository HEAD.

Observed evidence:
- Stage-12 architecture contract PASS;
- compile/link PASS;
- 17/19 runtime tests PASS;
- `navigation_runtime_planner` FAIL:
  `fixture must retain the future oriented portal as route context`;
- `navigation_composite_proving_ground` FAIL:
  `composite dynamic clearance lost for newtonian`.

### Planner fixture interpretation

The previous fixture repair moved the agent to X=0, exactly onto the minimum X
boundary of region 1 in `orientedPortalCaptureSpace()`. The new failure happens
before the actual bypass assertion: the test no longer retains the oriented portal
as route context. This strongly indicates the fixture was repaired in the wrong
place rather than a B4 regression. Use an interior start while preserving >2.75 m
separation from both start and staging endpoint (for example start X=1, blocker X=4, staging X=7).

### Composite interpretation

The B4 behavior itself improved materially:
- first solve: `AdjustedClear`, 29.38 m lateral offset, 22.5 m forward;
- physical replacement authored successfully;
- actual first replacement kept +4.747 m dynamic clearance and zero tracking violations;
- next receding-horizon solve again returned `AdjustedClear`;
- continuation kept +22.821 m actual dynamic clearance and zero tracking violations;
- next solve returned `NominalClear`.

The failure occurs **after** that successful B4 sequence. The composite then leaves
the receding-horizon planner loop and executes a fixed 10 s narrow-portal program
and then final capture while the dynamic hazard remains active. That violates the
new requirement that navigation/monitoring must remain active. A bounded segment
being nominal-clear does not prove the entire following scripted portal leg is clear.

Therefore the next fix should keep planner/monitor/replan ownership active through
the resumed topology leg instead of treating `NominalClear` as permission to run an
unmonitored long scripted phase.

### Visualisation

A visual trace is now justified. The useful first visualization should plot, in the
same 2D/3D scene, ship path, hazard path and inflated safety envelope, selected B4
targets, bounded nominal/reacquisition references, portal center, and replan points.
