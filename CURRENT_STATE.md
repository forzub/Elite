## B4 contract corrected after first target failure

The former same-horizon two-segment requirement is rejected.

Canonical ordinary local behavior is now:

```text
accepted route / trajectory
    -> physical visible horizon
    -> predicted dynamic/static occupancy
    -> can a safe executable short segment avoid the obstacle?
         yes -> accept that short off-route segment and keep moving
         no  -> issue active braking intent and keep navigation alive
    -> next receding-horizon update
         -> continue bypass while required
         -> begin reacquiring nominal line when safe
         -> converge back under physical steering/acceleration limits
```

There is **no arbitrary distance at which the ship must return to the route**.
In particular, no 30 m merge requirement exists.

The on-route `mergeTargetMapMeters` / runtime mirror is currently only a
reacquisition reference. It is not a mandatory endpoint of the current local
segment and is not required to be reachable inside the same horizon.

## Navigation continuity on failure

`ConflictHold` does not switch navigation off.

Runtime behavior is command-producing:

```text
no safe current bypass
    -> ConflictHold
    -> holdIntent
    -> negative velocity demand / braking
    -> physics continues
    -> navigation planner remains active
    -> fresh world state is evaluated again
```

This matches the required behavior: if there is time/space to evade, evade; if
there is not, brake and use the space that remains while continuing navigation.

## Current bypass selection

For equal lateral clearance the local solver now prefers the farther forward
bounded bypass station. This reduces gratuitous sideways kinks and better
preserves the route direction.

The selected short segment is proved against:
- exact static geometry;
- projected moving occupancy;
- time-coupled dynamic separation.

Physical maneuver authoring/capability proof remains downstream ownership.

## Test corrections

The stale portal-attitude fixture was corrected:
- start moved to X=0;
- blocker moved to X=3.5;
- staging/reacquisition reference remains X=7.

This makes both endpoints outside the 2.75 m required dynamic separation while
the nominal path is still genuinely blocked.

The old regression `testReturnLegIsAlsoProvenAgainstExactStaticGeometry()` was removed.
It is replaced by `testBypassDoesNotRequireImmediateReturnToTrajectory()`, which
deliberately blocks an immediate return leg while leaving a valid short bypass available.

The no-space regression remains and requires:
- `ConflictHold`;
- `localBypassExhausted`;
- active emergency braking intent.

## Validation status

**UNVERIFIED on target MinGW64.**

The next run must verify the new receding-horizon contract. Do not promote B4
until the target gate is green and the final composite demonstrates physically
reasonable behavior.

## Documentation protocol

After every state-affecting event update:
- `CURRENT_STATE.md`;
- `CURRENT_TASK.md`;
- `PROJECT_STATE.md`;
- `src/game/navigation/STAGE12_END_TO_END.md`;
- recreate `CONTINUE_PROMPT.md` from scratch.

## Composite physical fallback

The final composite no longer treats `fit.valid == false` as an automatic
test failure. If the geometric B4 segment cannot be authored within the
vehicle's current physical authority, the test now executes active braking
through the real PilotSkill/physics path, keeps the hazard authoritative,
and then continues the receding-horizon replan loop.

This directly pins the required rule:
- can evade physically -> execute bypass;
- cannot evade physically -> brake;
- navigation ownership remains active in both cases.

## 2026-09-20 target run `navigation_test_20260920-182430.txt`

Important: the uploaded log does **not** contain the tested HEAD line, so the
exact checkout must not be inferred from the filename or current repository HEAD.

Observed evidence:
- Stage-12 architecture contract PASS;
- compile/link PASS;
- 17/19 runtime tests PASS;
- `navigation_runtime_planner` FAIL:
  `fixture must retain the future oriented portal as route context`;
- `navigation_composite_proving_ground` FAIL:
  `composite dynamic clearance lost for newtonian`.

### Planner fixture interpretation

The previous fixture repair moved the agent to X=0, exactly onto the minimum X
boundary of region 1 in `orientedPortalCaptureSpace()`. The new failure happens
before the actual bypass assertion: the test no longer retains the oriented portal
as route context. This strongly indicates the fixture was repaired in the wrong
place rather than a B4 regression. Use an interior start while preserving >2.75 m
separation from both start and staging endpoint (for example start X=1, blocker X=4, staging X=7).

### Composite interpretation

The B4 behavior itself improved materially:
- first solve: `AdjustedClear`, 29.38 m lateral offset, 22.5 m forward;
- physical replacement authored successfully;
- actual first replacement kept +4.747 m dynamic clearance and zero tracking violations;
- next receding-horizon solve again returned `AdjustedClear`;
- continuation kept +22.821 m actual dynamic clearance and zero tracking violations;
- next solve returned `NominalClear`.

The failure occurs **after** that successful B4 sequence. The composite then leaves
the receding-horizon planner loop and executes a fixed 10 s narrow-portal program
and then final capture while the dynamic hazard remains active. That violates the
new requirement that navigation/monitoring must remain active. A bounded segment
being nominal-clear does not prove the entire following scripted portal leg is clear.

Therefore the next fix should keep planner/monitor/replan ownership active through
the resumed topology leg instead of treating `NominalClear` as permission to run an
unmonitored long scripted phase.

### Visualisation

A visual trace is now justified. The useful first visualization should plot, in the
same 2D/3D scene, ship path, hazard path and inflated safety envelope, selected B4
targets, bounded nominal/reacquisition references, portal center, and replan points.

## 2026-09-20 navigation runtime 3D viewer

Implemented an independent diagnostic viewer under `tools/navigation_runtime/`.

Files:
- `tools/navigation_runtime/NavigationTrace.h/.cpp` — shared deterministic JSON trace schema/IO;
- `tools/navigation_runtime/NavigationRuntimeViewer.cpp` — standalone GLFW/GLAD/GLM OpenGL 3D viewer;
- `tools/navigation_runtime/CMakeLists.txt` — isolated viewer build;
- `tools/navigation_runtime/run_mingw64.sh` — build/run helper;
- `tools/navigation_runtime/README.md` — controls and workflow.

The composite proving-ground test now writes the actual simulated run to
`tools/navigation_runtime/last_trace_<law>.json`. The writer is RAII-backed,
so the trace is retained when a later composite assertion throws.

Recorded data includes ship P/V/forward, dynamic-hazard P/radius, hull collision
envelope, planner safety envelope, actual dynamic clearance, phase/status,
selected B4 target, reacquisition reference, portal target and replan events.

Viewer presentation:
- topology route as a polyline;
- route turn/portal points as markers;
- actual ship trajectory;
- ship as an oriented wire rectangular box using Cobra half extents;
- explicit nose arrow;
- hazard trajectory and three wire envelopes;
- selected target / reacquisition / portal markers;
- all replan positions;
- current time/phase/status/clearance in the window title.

Controls: RMB orbit, MMB pan, wheel zoom, F fit, Space play/pause,
`[`/`]` frame step, R next replan, Esc close.

Validation state: source is committed but has NOT yet been compiled/run on the
target MinGW64 machine. Do not call the viewer accepted until that gate runs.

## 2026-09-20 target run on `c8972319390622a6b825bf0fa73e8a563c9d7068`

Verified on target MinGW64:
- navigation runtime configured and linked;
- 17/19 tests PASS;
- planner fixture still failed at future oriented portal route-context assertion;
- composite emitted `tools/navigation_runtime/last_trace_newtonian.json` with 770 frames;
- composite B4 sequence remained the same: two physically executed `AdjustedClear`
  segments, then `NominalClear`, then later dynamic-clearance failure;
- standalone viewer configure succeeded, but compile failed because the GLAD
  include root was wrong: source includes `<glad/gl.h>`, actual file is
  `glad/include/glad/gl.h`.

Fixes committed after that verified run:
- viewer CMake now includes `${ELITE_SOURCE_ROOT}/glad/include`;
- oriented-portal fixture now uses interior geometry start X=1, blocker X=4,
  stage X=7 while leaving global `baseAgent()` at its original X=0;
- these post-run fixes are UNVERIFIED until the next target run.

## 2026-09-20 viewer HUD iteration

Target feedback confirmed the standalone viewer now builds and opens, but the first
UI-less build was not self-explanatory: no visible buttons and no legend/state panel.

Viewer updated with an in-window diagnostic HUD:
- clickable PLAY/PAUSE, PREV, NEXT, NEXT REPLAN and FIT buttons;
- right-side live state panel with law/frame/time/phase/status/clearance;
- explicit `WHAT IS HAPPENING` explanation derived from trace phase/status;
- color legend for every diagnostic primitive;
- visible controls reminder;
- `portal_102` explicitly marked as the current known clearance-loss area.

The HUD uses a tiny built-in bitmap font and existing OpenGL primitives; no new UI
framework/dependency was introduced.

Validation state: previous viewer build/open is target-verified; the new HUD commit
still needs one target build/open check.

Same target run also showed planner fixture progress: the old route-context assertion
no longer fails; it now reaches `fixture must produce a safe adjusted target`. That
is a separate planner-fixture task and was not mixed into this HUD change.

## 2026-09-20 viewer physics/trace accuracy iteration

User clarified the viewer must remain an ordinary decorated Windows window, simply
maximized to the desktop work area; no exclusive/borderless game fullscreen.

Verified architecture of the current tool:
- composite test executes real Planner -> AcceptedManeuverProgram -> Follower ->
  runtime bridge -> SharedShipPhysics first;
- the viewer only replays the resulting JSON; it does not run planner/follower live;
- previous apparent low performance was primarily 0.10 s trace quantization (~10 Hz)
  with nearest-frame display, not evidence of a heavily loaded CPU.

Implemented, not yet target-verified:
- smooth interpolation between trace samples during playback;
- trace schema v2 records actual full ship basis forward/right/up (roll preserved);
- trace schema v2 records sampled AcceptedManeuverProgram reference P + full basis;
- viewer draws actual nose and program-reference nose separately and reports angular
  tracking error;
- viewer renders AcceptedManeuverProgram tracking.positionErrorMeters as a translucent
  tracking tube. This is explicitly NOT called a Planner volumetric corridor because
  NavigationRuntimePlanner::Result does not publish one;
- trace records hazard velocity + planner look-ahead;
- bottom-left `ГОРИЗОНТ КОБРЫ` inset projects the moving hazard and its predicted
  envelope tunnel onto Cobra's right/up plane perpendicular to actual forward;
- Russian HUD/Cyrillic bitmap support and Russian window title;
- interactive frame slider;
- ordinary GLFW window starts maximized.

Newtonian diagnostic correction:
- the composite test previously authored replacement/continuation programs with
  OrientationMode::VelocityAligned even under Newtonian law, making Newtonian motion
  visually look Assisted;
- Newtonian local bypass and the un-oriented portal-102 transit now preserve current
  body attitude (FixedStart); Assisted remains velocity-aligned;
- this change is unverified until the next target run.

Still pending and must not be faked in replay UI:
- pilot-skill selector (expert/average/loser);
- flight doctrine selector (standard/extreme);
- meaningful obstacle checkbox producing a different simulation, not merely hiding
  the obstacle;
- meaningful Assisted/Newtonian selector that runs/regenerates the scenario.
These require extracting/reusing a live scenario runner inside the tool or generating
distinct authoritative traces. Do not add cosmetic controls that leave physics unchanged.

## 2026-09-20 live navigation diagnostic stand

Architecture changed: `tools/navigation_runtime` is no longer a passive JSON trace
viewer. The JSON file is now an INPUT SCENARIO only. The executable calculates the
route and vehicle motion in-process when the user presses `РАССЧИТАТЬ`.

New production-chain runtime:
`scenario.json -> NavigationSpace/NavigationMap -> NavigationRuntimePlanner ->
AcceptedManeuverProgram -> TrajectoryFollower -> NavigationRuntimeControlBridge /
PilotSkillExecutor -> SharedShipPhysics / DynamicMotionSystem -> in-memory trace -> 3D`.

New files:
- `tools/navigation_runtime/NavigationScenarioRuntime.h`;
- `tools/navigation_runtime/NavigationScenarioRuntime.cpp`;
- `tools/navigation_runtime/scenario.json`.

Real UI inputs:
- control law: Assisted / Newtonian;
- pilot: Expert / Average / Loser;
- flight style: Standard / Extreme;
- sudden-obstacle checkbox;
- `РАССЧИТАТЬ` button.

Pilot choice changes the actual PilotSkillExecutor profile (reaction delay, decision
rate, latency, response, slew and deterministic command error). Flight style changes
real cruise speed and planner horizon/cost aggressiveness. Control law changes the
actual local flight law and maneuver attitude semantics.

Sudden obstacle semantics:
- unchecked: sudden obstacle is never published;
- checked: it is absent from initial NavigationMap and appears only after
  `activation_time_s` during the simulation;
- therefore the initial route has no foreknowledge of the surprise obstacle;
- after activation normal receding-horizon replanning reacts to it.

`scenario.json` supports:
- start P/V/forward/up;
- optional forced ship route points (default empty);
- final position;
- optional final forward/up constraints;
- final constant speed requirement;
- static sphere/box/capsule obstacles;
- moving obstacles defined by velocity vector OR route points + speed;
- sudden obstacle, including spawn relative to live ship forward/right/up.

The default scenario leaves `ship_route_points` empty so Planner must calculate the
route around the static obstacle rather than replay authored portal points.

Calculated white route now records the live sequence of Planner `selectedTarget`
decisions. Adjusted targets are marked as turn/bypass points. Actual motion remains
a separate rendered path.

Static obstacles from JSON are carried into the calculated TraceDocument and rendered
in 3D. `last_calculated_trace.json` is still saved for diagnostics, but is an OUTPUT,
not an input to the stand.

Build architecture:
`tools/navigation_runtime/CMakeLists.txt` now links the production navigation/control/
physics stack directly instead of being an OpenGL-only replay executable.

Validation state: this live-runtime iteration is committed but NOT YET compiled/run on
the target MinGW64 machine. Do not claim acceptance until the target gate passes.

## 2026-09-20 target video diagnosis — live stand integration bug

User supplied a screen recording of the first live-stand behavior.

Observed on-screen:
- playback around t≈41 s showed phase `ТОРМОЖЕНИЕ` and status `ДАННЫЕ УСТАРЕЛИ`;
- Cobra made almost no meaningful route progress;
- right diagnostic panel visibly jumped/blinked because conditional rows (especially
  the one-frame `СОБЫТИЕ: ПЕРЕПЛАНИРОВАНИЕ`) were inserted/removed from flow layout;
- the default no-sudden-obstacle run therefore did not demonstrate routing quality.

Root cause found in `NavigationScenarioRuntime.cpp`:
`NavigationRuntimePlanner::plan(... dynamicResultAgeSeconds ...)` was called with
`vehicle.timeSeconds` (absolute simulation time) instead of the age of the freshly
queried NavigationMap snapshot. With `maxResultAgeSeconds=0.25`, every plan after
0.25 s became `StaleHold`, correctly triggering fail-closed braking.

Fix committed:
- live stand now passes `0.0` for the just-created dynamic snapshot age;
- this is the correct semantics for the current synchronous query->plan call.

HUD fix committed:
- right panel uses hard fixed Y slots for mode/frame/time/phase/status/orientation/
  clearance/event/calculation result/explanation/legend/controls;
- optional data displays `-` instead of adding/removing rows;
- replan indication may still change color/text, but cannot move any other text;
- calculation result is always visible during playback so a partial failed trajectory
  is not silently presented as a successful solution.

Interpretation of previous daytime tests:
- they were not fake: they exercised real production planner/follower/control/physics
  components and found genuine local failures;
- however the composite fixture staged the scenario in manually authored phases and
  handcrafted AcceptedManeuverPrograms, so it did NOT prove a free-running arbitrary
  start->world->finish orchestration loop;
- the live stand exposed exactly that missing integration gate.

Important remaining architecture gap:
- current live stand still converts Planner output to a locally authored quintic
  `makeShortProgram`; it does not yet drive every nominal/replan segment through the
  full production B5/B6/B7/B8 physical compile/proof/selection/acceptance chain;
- therefore the next task is to replace that local adapter with the actual production
  maneuver compilation/proof chain before treating live-stand success as navigation
  acceptance evidence.

Validation state: snapshot-age and fixed-HUD patches are committed but not yet target
recompiled/replayed after this video.

## 2026-09-20 architecture correction — global corridor vs local dynamic avoidance

User clarified the intended ownership and this matches the existing LocalAvoidancePlanner contract:

- the nominal global route/corridor is built once from start to finish;
- it remains authoritative while the destination and static navigation world remain unchanged;
- moving obstacles do NOT trigger global route reconstruction;
- dynamic snapshots are consumed only by a bounded local monitor/avoidance layer;
- local avoidance may temporarily leave the nominal corridor, then progressively reacquire it;
- follower/autopilot continuously executes the current accepted trajectory/control program;
- the global planner is invoked again only when the goal changes or the static navigation world/corridor revision becomes invalid.

`maxResultAgeSeconds` / the ~0.25 s freshness limit is therefore a dynamic-snapshot safety contract, NOT a global replanning cadence.

Current live stand violates this architecture because it calls NavigationRuntimePlanner::plan repeatedly and therefore recomputes the static corridor every short execution slice.

Important current capability gap:
`NavigationSpace::queryCostedCorridor` currently returns a region/portal corridor and portal centers. Exact static NavigationObstacle geometry is used to prove/reject local segments, but the global corridor search does not yet synthesize a full geometric path around arbitrary exact obstacles inside one coarse region.

Therefore the default one-region + wall live scenario cannot honestly demonstrate the requested `start -> finish` global corridor yet. A proper global geometric corridor product must be added/cached first, then local dynamic avoidance must operate against that immutable nominal corridor.

## 2026-09-20 clarification — corridor is not the physical collision tunnel

User clarified terminology:
- `corridor` is a navigation/test abstraction around the nominal route used to ask
  whether the ship can generally proceed along that route;
- it is NOT the authoritative physical swept volume of the Cobra;
- exact wall contact / aperture passage must be decided by the future physical
  `tunnel` product: the time-parameterized swept volume of the actual hull along the
  accepted trajectory, including body orientation;
- therefore corridor visualization may be approximate and route-centric;
- tunnel proof is where it becomes critical whether Cobra's real hull clips walls.

Implication:
- do not over-engineer global corridor generation as exact hull clearance geometry;
- global planning may retain a centerline/polyline + coarse corridor for navigation;
- exact physical feasibility remains downstream ownership of trajectory/tunnel proof
  against exact static geometry and dynamic occupancy.

## 2026-09-20 full-chain evidence audit — why green slices did not mean green navigation

Re-audit performed after the live 3D stand exposed bad end-to-end behavior.

### Core conclusion

The previous tests were not fictitious: many of them exercised real production
Follower, PilotSkillExecutor, propulsion/physics, exact HitVolume geometry,
NavigationMap, NavigationSpace and parts of NavigationRuntimePlanner.

However, the evidence boundary was repeatedly over-interpreted. Most green tests
proved a component or a pre-authored slice, not the autonomous full chain:

`world/objective -> one retained global route -> local geometric response -> physical
maneuver generation -> continuous tunnel/proof -> decision -> ACCEPT -> follower ->
pilot -> physics -> event-driven monitor/replan -> finish`.

### What the main green test families actually proved

`ManeuverProgramExecutionLabTests`, `ManeuverCorridorMatrixTests`,
`ManeuverFlyThrough3dTests`, `ManeuverRigidBodyCorridorTests` and much of
`ManeuverChainedLimitMatrixTests` construct AcceptedManeuverProgram objects in the
test itself, then execute them through the real Follower/Bridge/Pilot/physics stack.
They prove execution/tracking of an already-good authored program. They do not prove
that production planning can generate that program from arbitrary world truth.

`NavigationRuntimePlannerTests` use deliberately authored region/portal fixtures. For
example the forced detour is already encoded by three regions and two known portals.
This validly proves topology/portal selection and local planner semantics, but not
automatic route synthesis around arbitrary raw obstacle geometry.

`OrdinaryPhysicalManeuverCompilerTests` genuinely test production B5 Newtonian
maneuver generation. They also explicitly pin that Assisted is unsupported in the
current first B5 slice, and candidates still require downstream continuous proof.
Therefore successful Assisted execution matrices were execution proofs of authored
programs, not proof of a production Assisted B5/B6/B7/B8 chain.

`NavigationCompositeProvingGroundTests` uses real planner/follower/physics components
but glues them together with test-owned helpers. Its topology is pre-authored through
portals; `makeProgram()` authors quintic programs; `buildDoctrineChoice()` authors
candidate programs/decision annotations; `fitAuthorityBoundedReplacement()` is a
test-side physical fitter. The file itself documents that production general B5
authoring remained a migration gap. The composite therefore was a proving ground,
not a production orchestrator.

The authoritative GameSimulation NavigationRuntimeLab was a real live test and remains
strong evidence for its narrow scope: real world objects/HitVolumes, real map/space,
real planner/control/physics and replication. But its slit/tunnel topology, approach,
entry/exit portals, start and goal are deterministic authored fixture data. It proves
that the live runtime can execute that authored topology/local situation; it does not
prove arbitrary `start + raw obstacles + finish -> full route/program` synthesis.

### Existing repository documentation already warned about this

`NAVIGATION_PIPELINE_AUDIT.md` explicitly says a unit test passing inside one stage is
not enough and records P6 ordinary maneuver generation / P7 proof integration / P8
ordinary decision integration / P9-P10 handoff as incomplete or transitional.

`NAVIGATION_V2_BLOCK_ARCHITECTURE.md` states B3 is event-driven, B5 current production
compiler is Newtonian-only, B6 proof is mandatory before ACCEPT, and the follower may
only execute the already accepted maneuver.

The project mistake was therefore not lack of warnings in code/docs; it was promoting
slice-level green evidence to a broader 'system works' interpretation.

### Why the new live stand looked dramatically worse

The new stand attempted, for the first time in this workflow, to synthesize much more
of the chain from a raw JSON scenario inside one executable. That immediately exposed
missing orchestration and also introduced new stand-side integration defects:
- absolute simulation time was mistakenly supplied as dynamic snapshot age, causing
  StaleHold/fail-closed braking;
- the stand periodically called the combined NavigationRuntimePlanner, incorrectly
  recomputing global/static planning instead of retaining one global route;
- the stand still uses its own `makeShortProgram()` quintic adapter, bypassing the
  complete production B5/B6/B7/B8 compile/proof/selection/acceptance chain;
- its default one-region + wall scenario asks current topology machinery to do a more
  general raw-obstacle route-synthesis job than the earlier authored-portal fixtures.

Thus the bad video is not evidence that Follower/PilotSkill/physics were fake. It is
evidence that the missing orchestration/handoff layers were never fully proved, and
that the newly written stand-side glue was itself incorrect.

### Evidence policy from now on

No collection of component/slice tests may be described as full navigation acceptance.
A true end-to-end acceptance must start from world/objective input and use the same
production products/handoffs as the game without test-authored maneuver programs or
test-only route/physics adapters.

Every test/result should be classified as one of:
- component/unit proof;
- execution of authored program;
- planner/topology slice;
- authoritative authored-world integration;
- true autonomous scenario end-to-end.

Only the last category may support a statement that the complete navigation chain
works for the scenario being tested.


## 2026-09-20 — Stage split implemented: Stage 1 static nominal route

The navigation diagnostic workflow is now explicitly split into two stages.

### Stage 1 — current implementation

One retained nominal route is built once from start to finish through static obstacle
geometry.

New production-facing component:
- `src/game/navigation/NominalRoutePlanner.h/.cpp`.

It wraps the existing `GeometricPathPlanner` backend behind an explicit v2 ownership
contract and returns a sparse polyline only. It accepts optional required authored
checkpoints and a coarse navigation envelope/clearance.

Nominal-route validity is revision driven:
- goal revision changed -> rebuild;
- static-world revision changed -> rebuild;
- dynamic-world revision changed -> **do not rebuild**.

The dynamic revision is deliberately present in `ValidityQuery` and deliberately
ignored by nominal-route invalidation. A regression test pins this behavior.

The live diagnostic stand now runs only Stage 1 on `РАССЧИТАТЬ`:

```text
JSON start/checkpoints/finish
 + static obstacles
 -> NominalRoutePlanner
 -> retained static route polyline
 -> viewer
```

It no longer runs the old half-second Planner/Follower/physics loop during Stage 1.
Therefore the two previously identified stand defects are removed from the canonical
Stage-1 path:
- no periodic global route replanning;
- no stand-local `makeShortProgram()` presented as production maneuver execution.

The ship remains at the start pose in Stage 1. The viewer shows the calculated route
and static obstacles only.

### Corridor/tunnel boundary

`route_envelope_radius_m` and `route_clearance_m` are coarse route/corridor inputs.
They are not exact physical collision proof. Exact Cobra wall/aperture contact belongs
to the later time-parameterized swept-hull tunnel proof.

### Dynamic-ready boundary

The scenario schema still accepts moving obstacles and a sudden obstacle. Stage 1 does
not use them for route reconstruction. Stage 2 will consume them as a local dynamic
overlay against the retained nominal route.

### Validation state

Code is committed but the new Stage-1 target has not yet been compiled/run on the
user's MinGW64 machine. Do not claim target acceptance until that run is supplied.


## 2026-09-20 Stage-1 cleanup lock

The Stage-1 diagnostic boundary was tightened after the initial implementation:
- old stand-local `makeShortProgram`, periodic planner loop, Follower/PilotSkill/
  SharedShipPhysics execution and dynamic publication code were removed from
  `NavigationScenarioRuntime.cpp` rather than merely left dormant;
- `tools/navigation_runtime/CMakeLists.txt` now links only the nominal-route/static
  geometry core for Stage 1;
- moving/sudden obstacle records remain parseable in the scenario schema as reserved
  Stage-2 inputs, but cannot influence the Stage-1 route;
- a new architecture checker pins that Stage 1 cannot regress into execution/replan
  ownership;
- target validation is still pending on the user's MinGW64 machine.


## Architecture-gate compatibility fix

During pre-handoff audit, the existing `check_geometric_path_planner.py` was found to
encode an obsolete ownership assumption: it required the same geometric planner .cpp
to appear twice in root CMake. Current runtime architecture already compiles it once in
shared `EliteNavigationGeometry`, which both client/server navigation runtime reuse.
The checker now pins that shared-library ownership instead of duplicate compilation.
This is an architecture-test correction only; route behavior is unchanged.


## 2026-09-21 target Stage-1 validation result

User target machine checkout: `5da0be0d05ef91958a0e7dc9adda3b4eb8fdee29`.

Observed:
- new `nominal_route_planner` test PASS;
- architecture suite stopped on an obsolete pre-System-frame marker in
  `check_navigation_live_runtime_control.py`;
- old Stage-2 `navigation_runtime_planner` still fails its adjusted-target fixture;
- old Stage-2 composite still fails at the narrow-passage full-hull check after a
  Newtonian dynamic bypass;
- all other 18/20 runtime tests passed.

Interpretation:
- Stage 1 static nominal route code itself passed its new behavioral test;
- the two red runtime tests are Stage-2 execution/local-dynamic regressions and must
  remain visible, but they do not invalidate Stage-1 static route acceptance;
- the architecture failure was not a behavior regression: the checker still expected
  `...Map...` control-field names while production had already migrated to explicit
  `...System...` names.

Fixes committed after this run:
- updated `check_navigation_live_runtime_control.py` to the current System-frame field
  names and `applySystemAccelerationDemand` API;
- labeled `nominal_route_planner` with CTest label `navigation_stage1`;
- added `tests/navigation_runtime/run_stage1_mingw64.sh` as the focused Stage-1 gate.

The focused gate runs only:
1. shared geometric-path architecture contract;
2. Stage-1 nominal-route architecture contract;
3. `nominal_route_planner` behavioral test;
4. Stage-1 viewer build.

This is not hiding the old red tests. It prevents Stage-2 failures from being
misreported as Stage-1 route-construction failures.


## 2026-09-21 — Stage-1 viewer observability fix after user screenshot

User screenshot showed a blank 3D area before pressing `РАССЧИТАТЬ`. After calculation the scene/route appeared, but there was no movement, making it impossible from the UI to tell whether Planner or Follower had failed.

Clarification: Stage 1 is route-only by design; Follower is not linked or executed. The UI was misleading because legacy playback controls remained visible as ordinary controls and the pre-calculation scene had no sufficiently explicit authored-scene rendering contract.

Fixes now committed:
- `TraceDocument` carries explicit authored `sceneStartMapMeters` / `sceneFinishMapMeters` independent of route existence;
- `loadScenarioPreview()` and calculated results populate those endpoints;
- viewer renders a reference grid, a large green START marker, a large yellow FINISH marker/ring, static obstacle geometry and Cobra-at-start before calculation;
- `fitCamera()` explicitly includes authored scene endpoints, so preview framing no longer depends on a calculated route;
- fixed diagnostics panel is placed below the top controls and shows the chain state without vertical reflow;
- Stage-1 playback controls are visually labeled `ПОЛЁТ: ЭТАП 2` / `FOLLOWER: OFF` and cannot start playback when only the one route frame exists;
- `ScenarioRunResult` now exposes diagnostics;
- calculation writes console diagnostics plus `tools/navigation_runtime/last_route_plan.log`;
- diagnostic chain explicitly distinguishes `SCENE`, `PLANNER`, and `FOLLOWER: NOT RUN (STAGE 1)`;
- Stage-1 architecture checker now pins pre-calculation scene endpoints, preview loading and diagnostic ownership.

This does not start Stage 2. No Follower/physics execution was reintroduced.

Target validation pending for these viewer/diagnostic changes.


## 2026-09-21 — Follower restored as Stage 2 of the same diagnostic stand

User correctly rejected the previous interpretation where splitting work into two stages
removed Follower/physics from the viewer entirely. The intended split is by ownership,
not by executable:

```text
Stage 1: Calculate
  static scene -> NominalRoutePlanner -> retained route polyline

Stage 2: Execute
  retained route polyline -> time trajectory -> Follower -> PilotSkill -> physics
```

The same viewer now supports both stages.

### Stage 1 remains unchanged

`РАССЧИТАТЬ` calls only `NominalRoutePlanner`. It builds the static route once. The
user's target evidence already showed a valid four-point 323.75 m detour around the
wall. Control law, pilot skill and flight style do not alter this nominal route.

### Stage 2 restored correctly

After a successful Stage 1 the playback button becomes `ЗАПУСТИТЬ ПОЛЁТ`.

Stage 2 consumes `calculatedRoute.routePoints` directly and MUST NOT invoke
`NominalRoutePlanner::plan`, `NavigationRuntimePlanner::plan`, or any other global
route search.

Current static Stage-2 chain:

```text
retained Stage-1 polyline
 -> TrajectoryGenerator / RuckigRoutePlanner
 -> time-parameterized trajectory
 -> bounded AcceptedManeuverProgram chunks
 -> TrajectoryFollower
 -> NavigationRuntimeControlBridge
 -> PilotSkillExecutor
 -> SharedShipPhysics + DynamicMotionSystem
 -> playback trace
```

The former stand-local `makeShortProgram()` quintic shortcut is NOT restored.

### Execution modes

The existing viewer selectors now become real Stage-2 inputs:
- Newtonian / Assisted -> physical local flight law + reference-attitude policy;
- Expert / Average / Loser -> real PilotSkillExecutor profiles;
- Standard / Extreme -> Ruckig route speed request.

Pilot execution starts from neutral revision zero so the first real route intent exercises
the selected pilot's reaction-delay model.

### Static-only dynamic boundary

Dynamic/sudden obstacles remain reserved for the next pass. Stage 2 currently reports
`DYNAMIC AVOIDANCE: NOT ENABLED IN STATIC PASS`; it does not silently use the sudden
obstacle checkbox and does not rebuild the route.

### Diagnostics

Stage 2 writes:
- stdout lines prefixed `[NAV-STAGE2]`;
- `tools/navigation_runtime/last_execution.log`;
- `tools/navigation_runtime/last_execution_trace.json`.

Diagnostics separate Ruckig trajectory generation, Follower, Pilot bridge, final errors,
route deviation and coarse static contact.

### Physical-proof limitation

The current static execution path uses the coarse route envelope for static collision
checks and is useful for observing Follower/physics behavior. It is NOT yet final B6
oriented swept-hull/tunnel proof. Do not promote a visually successful run to full
navigation acceptance.

### Validation state

This restored Stage-2 execution path is committed but has NOT yet been compiled/run on
the user's MinGW64 target. The last target-verified fact remains: Stage-1 nominal route
planner passed and produced the four-point 323.75 m static detour.


## 2026-09-21 — immutable retained route for Stage-2 comparisons

Viewer state now keeps the successful Stage-1 `TraceDocument` as a separate immutable
retained-route snapshot. Stage-2 execution traces no longer replace the only copy of the
Planner result.

Changing control law, pilot skill, flight style or the reserved sudden-obstacle toggle
after an execution run restores the retained Stage-1 route and marks only Stage 2 stale.
The next execution run reuses the exact same route without calling Planner again.

This is required for clean comparisons such as Expert/Newtonian vs Average/Assisted:
route geometry is held constant while only the execution layer changes.


## 2026-09-21 — target gate false negative in Stage-2 architecture checker

Target run stopped before compilation with:

`[FAIL] static-route/two-stage navigation: Stage-2 execution path missing TrajectoryGenerator::generate`

This was a checker defect, not a runtime defect. The checker isolated only the body of
`executeCalculatedRoute()`, while the actual Ruckig call is correctly delegated to
`buildExecutionTrajectory()`:

```text
executeCalculatedRoute()
 -> buildExecutionTrajectory()
 -> TrajectoryGenerator::generate()
```

Fix committed in `tests/architecture_contracts/check_navigation_stage1_nominal_route.py`:
- execution function must call `buildExecutionTrajectory()`;
- trajectory-builder slice must contain `calculatedRoute.routePoints` and
  `TrajectoryGenerator::generate`;
- global-planner prohibition is checked across the owned Stage-2 trajectory-builder +
  execution text.

No production navigation/runtime behavior changed in this fix.

Validation state: target compilation of the restored Stage-2 viewer still has NOT been
reached. Rerun the focused gate from latest main.
